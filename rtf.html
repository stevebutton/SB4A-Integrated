    <h4>Mapping PPD stakeholders</h4>
    <p>Mapping of the local businesses is a first step towards any structured dialogue with the private sector. Mappings allow to : <br>1.Identify the key actors in a given country and/or sector, determine how they interact with development and governance processes and understand their dynamics; .Use an evolutive approach taking into consideration the respective roles and positions of these actors, as well as their interactions with other actors and their objectives, strengths and weaknesses in order to eventually strengthen their capacity as partners in development or involve them in policy dialogue at national and sectoral levels. When conducted by EU Delegations, PS Mappings allow to obtain a thorough understanding of the private sector presence in the country, and to recommend actions accordingly.</p>

    <p>When SB4A was launched, a in-depth knowledge of the state of play of PPD in African partner countries was sought to better understand, at a country level, what were the mechanisms in place, their characteristics, and the involvement of each EU Delegation to support public-private dialogue. The first SB4A State of Play is based on a survey sent by email to all 49 EU Delegations in Africa on the March 2019.</p>

    <p>In 2017, the European Union adopted the European Investment Plan (EIP) to remove constraints to private investment in partner country markets and to support priority reforms.</p>
    <p>The EIP provides a comprehensive and integrated approach, linking investment mobilization (pillar 1) with technical assistance (pillar 2) and investment climate improvement (pillar 3) . </p>
    <p>Three building blocks compose Pilar 3 and are closely interlinked:</p>

    <h4>2014 Communication on Private Sector and SB4A</h4>
    <p>In that same Communication, the EC foresees that EU Delegations will play an active role in enabling inclusive public-private policy dialogue by<em> “supporting the functioning of existing or new dialogue mechanisms such as national employment, labour or export councils, and by targeting capacity building to private sector representatives, including chambers of commerce, social partners, and organizations representing micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, female entrepreneurs, and firms and workers in the informal sector, to improve their contribution to such dialogue mechanisms”. </em></p>

    <p>Private Sector Engagement refers to activities of donors that enable and encourage private sector actors to contribute to development objectives. </p>
    <p>PSE can lead to an improved investment climate and potentially contribute to achieving a more inclusive growth. Indeed, by enabling and setting incentives for investments in low-income communities and sectors that specifically benefit the poor, the EU can provide incentives for the private sector to operate towards poor communities .</p>

    <h4>Structured Dialogue</h4>
    <p>“Structured dialogue” describes the process of engaging with stakeholders in a planned, regular, timely, predictable and transparent manner. </p>
    <p>It is used in contrast to “ad-hoc consultations” as stakeholders are invited to provide their input in a well-planned set-up, and they receive feedback of the outcomes of the consultations as well as information about the overall process of dialogue. </p>
    <p>It is also different from “one-off consultations”, where the EU seeks a specific input from the private sector.</p>

    <h4>Public-Private Dialogue</h4>
    <p>“Public-private dialogue” (PPD) is a type of structured dialogue. It is a systematic, planned, participatory, and inclusive approach to policymaking. </p>
    <p>It is directed at reforming governance and the business climate, especially where other policy institutions are underperforming. Dialogue improves the flow of information relating to economic policy and builds legitimacy into the policy process. </p>
    <p>It also seeks to overcome impediments to transparency and accommodate greater inclusion of stakeholders in decision-making.</p>

    </figure>
    <h4>Public-Private Dialogue</h4>
    <p>-The benefits of Public-Private Dialogues are not immediate but span in the long run. Indeed, frequent consultations with the private sector help governments to prioritise reforms and secure confidence from investors in a long-term perspective. PPDs contribute to promote transparency, good governance and encourage governments to perform regulatory impact assessments, therefore creating better jobs through new or expanded inclusive businesses.</p>

    <h4>Public-Private Dialogue</h4>
    <p>-Sector specific PPD: Practitioners believe that sector-specific PPDs can sometimes bring more direct and tangible results than PPD on crosscutting issues and provide to stakeholders more incentives to collaborate. Sector-specific structured dialogue nonetheless present risks: lack of integration into the crosscutting dialogue process, difficult selection of priority reform sectors, and lack of transparency. More generally, there is a trade-off between “representativeness” and “capacity for dialogue”: cross-sector private sector organisations are more likely to gather a large number of stakeholders and have a better understanding of the broader business environment. On the contrary, sectoral organisations generally have an in-depth knowledge of key sectoral issues but miss the bigger picture of the business environment.</p>

    <h4>Monitoring &amp; evaluating PPDs</h4>
    <p>A participatory approach is considered as a best practice to implement M&amp;E of PPDs, and all stakeholders should be involved. </p>
    <p>M&amp;E should not only cover enactment of reforms, but also scrutinize their implementation after adoption. Finally, targeted inputs, outputs, outcomes and impacts should be defined with specific indicators and reviewed periodically by PPD stakeholders.</p>
    <p>The objective is to identify a methodology based on international practice and adapt it to the needs of SB4A.</p>

    <h4>Monitoring &amp; evaluating PPDs</h4>
    <p>According to the PPD Charter 10, Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (M&amp;E)  is an effective tool to manage the public-private dialogue process and to demonstrate its purpose and performance. </p>
    <p>The advantages of monitoring and evaluation are numerous: M&amp;E techniques improve overall planning of PPDs, facilitate advocacy, and increase incentives to promote more effective implementation. M&amp;E mechanisms should remain simple and flexible in order to serve as a tool to promote transparency and accountability.</p>

    <h5>Including Women</h5>
    <p><strong>‍</strong>Empowering women entrepreneurs to identify the constrains they face in their business life and supporting them to constructively participate to PPD is key to correct gender inequalities affecting the private sector. Integrating a gender perspective into PPDs can occur at two levels:<br>At policy and action level, a gender lens can be applied to a PPD’s outputs and outcomes, whether these are about legal or regulatory reform or about undertaking a specific set of actions; At PPD implementation level, applying a gender lens aims to ensure that women are equally represented in the dialogue process.  <br>&quot;</p>

    <h5>Including informal sector</h5>
    <p>In developing countries, where the informal sector is dominant, it is crucial that small, micro and informal entrepreneurs participate to public-private consultations, and their capacities should be built to allow them to express their interests in a coherent and analytical manner. Informal worker associations do exist in some countries and represent sectors such as petty traders and small street vendors.  According to the OECD, two types of interventions should be implemented to support MSMEs and informal sector to participate to BER: a.supporting the establishment of intermediary organisations representing micro and informal enterprises and stimulating linkages and cooperation between them; b.and b) encouraging existing private sector organisations to become more representative and strengthening their understanding of micro and informal enterprises’ constraints67.</p>

    <p>The coronavirus pandemic that started late 2019/early 2020 and the restrictive measures taken all over the world to reduce the spread of the virus have had dramatic impact on our global economies, and in particular on those of developing countries. The private sector can bring valuable contributions to address the sanitary and socio-economic impact of the outbreak, and governments and development partners should more than ever actively look for ways to diminish the impact of the crisis on businesses and job losses, and pave the way to a quicker and sustainable economy recovery.</p>

    <p>Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) is particularly useful in fragile and conflict affected states (FCAS) to mitigate entrenched interests, rebuild trust and spur inclusive and sustainable growth.

    <h4>Facilitating PPD</h4>
    <p>To facilitate public-private dialogue, EU Delegations must focus on these four success factors:</p>
    <h5>Working with Champions</h5>
    <h5>Inclusiveness</h5>
    <h5>Sustainability</h5>
    <h5>Capacity</h5>

    </figure>
    <h4>Facilitating PPD</h4>
    <h5>1 - Working with Champions</h5>
    <p>The first success factor is to identify and work with Champions from the public and private sectors, to let them take ownership of the dialogue process. Putting Champions at the forefront of PPD will allow the whole process to gain credibility and lead to stronger recognition. Public sector champions are partners with strong leadership and buy-in. Private sector champions are business representative that are independent and have the ability to represent a group or community.</p>

    </figure>
    <h4>Facilitating PPD</h4>
    <h5>2 - Inclusiveness</h5>
    <p>The dialogue will be as inclusive as possible, reaching out and taking in consideration independent structures, supporting unorganised interests to participate and accomodating and representing the diversity of private sector interests. All kinds of businesses should be reached out to and included in the discussions, be they formal and informal, large and small, local or international.</p>

    </figure>
    <h4>Facilitating PPD</h4>
    <h5>3 - Sustainability </h5>
    <p>To be sustainable, a public-private dialogue process must meet operational and financial sustainability and have a sustained mandate. In the case of a donor supporting PPD and once it meets these 3 sustainability pillars, the donor can exit the process successfully.</p>

    </figure>
    <h4>Facilitating PPD</h4>
    <h5>4 - Capacity </h5>
    <p>PPD stakeholder, be they public or private, need strong capacities to provide coherent policy recommendations, negotiate constructively, analyse evidence and nurture the on-going dialogue. On the private sector side, organisations must be in capacity to propose evidence-based reforms and coordinate businesses’ interests, while public sector representatives must have the capacity and resources to analyse, formulate coherent reforms, implement and monitor the reforms and communicate with stakeholders.</p>

    <h4 data-w-id="c8326071-f7f8-abb6-601f-aaa6079d96ca">Mapping PPD stakeholders</h4>
    <p>Mapping of the local businesses is a first step towards any structured dialogue with the private sector. Mappings allow to : <br>1.Identify the key actors in a given country and/or sector, determine how they interact with development and governance processes and understand their dynamics; .Use an evolutive approach taking into consideration the respective roles and positions of these actors, as well as their interactions with other actors and their objectives, strengths and weaknesses in order to eventually strengthen their capacity as partners in development or involve them in policy dialogue at national and sectoral levels.</p>

It is used in contrast to “ad-hoc consultations” as stakeholders are invited to provide their input in a well-planned set-up, and they receive feedback of the outcomes of the consultations as well as information about the overall process of dialogue. It is also different from “one-off consultations”, where the EU seeks a specific input from the private sector.</div>
